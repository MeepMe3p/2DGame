-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
!! FXML AND CONTROLLERS !!

[1] Make sure to properly export the fxml_controller package inside
 module-info found in src/main/java/module-info.java

[2] The SceneHandler class manages the switching of scenes between the Sign-Up, Sign-In,
 and Chat-Box FXML files.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
!! DATABASE !!

[1] Add the JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) MySQL connector dependency to Maven by including
 the following dependency in your pom.xml file.
 (See link: https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.mysql/mysql-connector-java/8.0.0).

 Make sure to require and import sql class properly

[2] To configure MySQL entries, including the database root and password,
 refer to the MySQLConnect class.

[3] Database Schema (Update this info for every system or database!)
 Create a new database named 'dboop_capstone' or configure it in the MySQLConnector class.
 If you do not have a copy of the database, uncomment the code in the Main class that
 creates the necessary tables.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
!! Socket !!

[1] The Server and ClientHandler classes may be run on separate machine.
 Just make sure to add the proper IP address.

[2] It is important that the server receives a username as the first message.
 Check the ClientHandler class for details.
